bluemix-qna
===========

A sample IBM Bluemix app which lets you ask travel or healthcare-related questions using Watson's Question and Answer API.  Here's where [you can try out the app](http://gregstoll-qna.mybluemix.net/demo), and see [this guide](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/qaapi/#sampleApp) for how to get started with your own.

I made modifications in src/com/ibm/cloudoe/samples/DemoServlet.java to add the CSS class for confidence, and styled it in WebContent/css/style.css and WebContent/index.jsp.
